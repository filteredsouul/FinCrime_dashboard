## 3. Fraud Trend Analysis

### 3.1 Weekly Evolution
- **Peak**: Weeks **W14â€“W15**, with ~Â£130k/week in fraudulent amounts.
- **Post-peak decline**: Progressive reduction after W15, suggesting:
  - Potential effectiveness of new detection rules.
  - Seasonal or event-driven fraud spikes.

**Recommendation:**  
Perform a root-cause analysis of the W14â€“W15 surge to confirm whether it was triggered by:
- External events (e.g., public holidays, marketing campaigns).
- Exploitation of a system loophole later patched.
- Fraud migration from another channel.

## 4. Transaction Type Analysis

### 4.1 Volume distribution
- **TOPUP** dominates both total transaction volume and fraudulent transaction count.
- Other common types: CARD_PAYMENT, TRANSFER, ATM, EXCHANGE.

### 4.2 Fraud concentration
- Fraud rate highest in **TOPUP** operations.
- Possible reasons:
  - Lower friction or verification in funding events.
  - Use of stolen credentials/cards to inject funds.

**Recommendation:**  
- Apply velocity checks on repeat top-ups within short timeframes.
- Add KYC verification layers for large or unusual top-up amounts.
- Monitor the origin of funds (bank accounts, cards, external wallets).

---

## 5. Geographic Analysis

### 5.1 Fraud hotspots
- **Ireland (IE)** and **Cyprus (CY)** rank highest in both fraudulent amounts and transaction counts.
- Gap with next countries is significant.

### 5.2 Possible drivers
- Jurisdiction-specific vulnerabilities.
- Regulatory or enforcement gaps.
- Coordinated fraud rings targeting these markets.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement **market-specific rules** for IE and CY (stricter authentication, additional document checks).
- Increase fraud analyst coverage for these markets.
- Engage with local authorities for intelligence sharing.

## 6. Operational Implications

### Short-term actions
1. **Enhance TOPUP controls** (source-of-funds, velocity limits, enhanced due diligence).
2. **Deploy targeted rules** for IE and CY.
3. **Automate weekly anomaly detection** for fraud rate spikes.

### Medium-term actions
4. **Integrate behavioural analytics** to detect unusual transaction sequences.
5. **Refine alert prioritisation** to focus on high-value/high-risk transactions.
6. **Conduct quarterly hotspot reviews** to adjust controls per country.

---

## 7. Next Steps for the Dashboard

- **Real-time monitoring**: Integrate streaming data to move from weekly to daily/hourly resolution.
- **Drill-down capabilities**: Add per-user fraud timelines for investigation.
- **Link analysis**: Visualise connections between fraudulent accounts and transactions.
- **Alert export**: Enable CSV/PDF export for case management systems.

---

## 8. Conclusion

The analysis confirms that:
- Fraud is concentrated in **specific transaction types (TOPUP)** and **specific geographies (IE, CY)**.
- There is a temporal component, with a notable spike in W14â€“W15.
- Focused interventions in these areas can yield the highest impact.

Maintaining and refining this dashboard will allow Revolutâ€™s fraud teams to **move faster from detection to prevention**, optimising both security and customer experience.
